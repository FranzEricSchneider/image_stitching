How I got the OpenCV stitcher sample code to compile

I was #include-ing the following headers
	#include <opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp>
	#include <opencv2/highgui.hpp>
	#include <opencv2/stitching.hpp>

So I right-clicked on the Code::Blocks project and went
	rghtclk > Build Options > Search directories > Compiler > Add > /usr/local/lib/opencv2
	rghtclk > Build Options > Search directories > Linker > Add > /usr/local/lib
	rghtclk > Build Options > Linker settings > Add >
		/usr/local/lib/libopencv_stitching.so
		/usr/local/lib/libopencv_core.so.3.0
		/usr/local/lib/libopencv_highgui.so
		/usr/local/lib/libopencv_imgcodecs.so

I chose these locations because I went and checked and found the opencv code there

I had trouble with cv::cvtColor until I added to Linker settings
		/usr/local/lib/libopencv_calib3d.so

I had trouble with
	vector<AprilTags::TagDetection> detections = m_tagDetector->extractTags(image_gray);
	and
	detections[i].draw(image);
	and
	detection.getRelativeTranslationRotation(m_tagSize, m_fx, m_fy, m_px, m_py,
                                            translation, rotation);
until I added to Linker settings
		/usr/local/lib/libopencv_imgproc.so
